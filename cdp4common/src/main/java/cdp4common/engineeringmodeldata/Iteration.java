/**
 * representation of an Iteration of an EngineeringModel
 * Note 1: An iteration is a version of the EngineeringModel that was considered as one complete and coherent step in the development of the EngineeringModel in a concurrent engineering activity. The detailed definition and understanding of the meaning of a "complete and coherent" step depends on the organization and activity that develops the EngineeringModel.
 * Note 2: In a concurrent engineering activity the engineering model for the system-of-interest is developed in a number of iterations, where in each iteration the problem specification in the form of the RequirementsSpecification and a design solution in the form of the Options and ElementDefinitions are elaborated and refined. With an iteration the engineering team strives to set one more step in the direction of achieving a converged definition that fulfills the objectives of their activity.
