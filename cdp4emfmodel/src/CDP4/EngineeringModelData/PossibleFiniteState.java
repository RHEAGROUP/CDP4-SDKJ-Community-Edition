 * Note:&#160;Finite states are used as a general concept to represent mission phases as well as system, subsystem and equipment modes, and in general any set of discrete states that are useful for a system definition. Parameters may have different values depending on the state that an element of a system is in, see the <i>stateDependence</i> property of Parameter.
